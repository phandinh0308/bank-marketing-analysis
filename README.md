## 🔍 Key Insights

1. **<25 age group** has the highest response rate (~24%) — driven by digital reactivity, not loyalty.
2. **≥55 age group** is financially responsive (~18.8%) — favoring offline channels.
3. **University-educated customers** dominate response volume, but medium education tiers show untapped potential.
4. **Admin and blue-collar jobs** yield strong engagement — but differ in optimal contact timing.
5. **Calls >400s** drastically outperform short ones — longer conversations build trust.
6. **Mobile phone contacts** yield far higher conversion than landlines.
7. **Top months** for response: March, September, October — showing seasonal behavior.
8. **Conversion drops after 3 campaigns** — overexposure causes message fatigue.
